/**
 * Word-style progressive open for large documents.
 *
 * Mounting a 60-page document in one setContent keeps the "Opening…" screen up
 * until the whole ProseMirror DOM is built and laid out — the dominant share of
 * cold-open time. Instead, mount enough blocks to overfill the first screens,
 * let the browser paint them, then append the tail in frame-sized chunks while
 * the user already reads page 1 (the page count in the status bar grows as the
 * tail streams in, like Word's background pagination).
 *
 * While the tail streams the document is incomplete, so:
 * - the editor stays editable except at the append boundary (the streaming
 *   tail guard refuses edits in or after the last mounted block),
 * - saves must wait on waitForFullContent() — a mid-stream save would
 *   serialize, and write to disk, a truncated document,
 * - appends bypass undo history and restore the dirty flag, so streaming is
 *   not an edit; history resets once the tail lands unless the user edited
 *   meanwhile (their undo stack must survive).
