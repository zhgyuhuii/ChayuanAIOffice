| Font             | License    | Metric-compatible Word counterpart |

| Carlito GO       | OFL 1.1    | Calibri (Word's default body font) |

"Carlito GO" (`Carlito-*.ttf`) is a derivative of Carlito 1.103: a build-time patch
(`tools/patch-carlito-vi.py`) rebuilds Vietnamese precomposed glyphs whose above mark
(circumflex/breve) was dropped (Ậ/Ệ/Ộ in Regular/Bold); advance widths are unchanged.
Renamed per OFL 1.1 §2 — "Carlito" is a Reserved Font Name. The files live in
`packages/ui/src/fonts/` (shared with sheets and slides, which alias Calibri/Aptos
to the same faces) and are referenced here as `@chatoffice/ui/fonts/Carlito-*.ttf`.

Purpose: when a Word font declared by the document is missing on this machine, the
browser's silent fallback (Helvetica etc.) changes glyph widths, so line-break points
and pagination diverge from Word. Falling back to a metric-compatible font keeps
canvas line breaking aligned with Word, and stays consistent with the offline
pagination model (`tests/helpers/lo-fonts.ts` measures the same set of files).

Registration lives in `fonts.css`; family-name mapping in `cssFontFamily()` of `line-metrics.ts`.

"Aptos GO" / "Aptos Display GO" are not separate files: they are `size-adjust`ed
views of the Carlito faces (Word probe 2026-09-03 against Word's bundled Aptos).
Aptos letters run ~6.8% wider than Carlito's, digits +5.4%, the space 10%
narrower, so each weight registers three faces (general, `U+0030-0039`,
`U+0020/00A0`) — later faces win inside their unicode-range. Aptos Display is
close to Carlito for letters but shares the narrow space. Pitch stays Calibri's
1.22 (`lineHeightFactor`). `tests/aptos-alias-metrics.test.ts` holds the probed
sentence widths.

## CJK fallback

| Font                                    | Role                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Noto Sans CJK SC (GB2312-subset woff2)  | fallback for heiti-style (sans) families   |
| Noto Serif CJK SC (GB2312-subset woff2) | fallback for songti-style (serif) families |

Source: [notofonts/noto-cjk](https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk) (SIL OFL 1.1),
subset with fonttools to all 7,445 GB2312 Han characters + CJK punctuation/fullwidth
forms + basic Latin
(`pyftsubset --text-file=gb2312 --unicodes="U+0020-024F,U+2000-206F,U+3000-303F,U+FF00-FFEF" --flavor=woff2`).
Rare characters outside the subset still fall through to system fonts (shown as
missing glyphs in minimal environments); bold is synthesized by the browser.

The serif subset also backs the `ChatOffice Fullwidth TC` face (`fonts.css`), a
unicode-range shim (U+FF0D/FF0F/FF3C/FF3F/FF5E) slotted before Songti TC in the
Traditional Chinese serif chain: Songti TC draws those fullwidth glyphs at
~0.2-0.5em of ink inside the 1em advance, so a PMingLiU document's U+FF0F
rendered as a spaced half-width slash. Real PMingLiU (Windows) still wins by
chain order; advances are 1.0em everywhere, so line breaking is unchanged.

## Korean fallback

| Font                                 | Role                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ChatOffice Serif KR (subset woff2)    | Batang-metric stand-in for Korean serif families            |
| ChatOffice Sans KR (subset woff2)     | fallback for Korean sans families (Malgun etc.)             |
| ChatOffice Che Latin KR (ASCII woff2) | half-width Latin for BatangChe/GulimChe/DotumChe/GungsuhChe |

Source: Noto Serif/Sans CJK KR Regular from [notofonts/noto-cjk](https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk)
(SIL OFL 1.1), subset with fonttools to the 2,350 KS X 1001 syllables + jamo
(U+1100-11FF, U+3130-318F) + basic Latin/CJK punctuation/fullwidth forms
(`U+0020-024F,U+2000-206F,U+3000-303F,U+FF00-FFEF`), then hmtx-normalized to the
metrics of the Windows faces Word substitutes for missing Korean fonts: hangul
syllables/compatibility jamo → 1.0em (Noto CJK KR ships 0.92/0.966em, which
would shift line breaks ~8% vs Word), serif digits → 0.596em and space →
0.333em (measured Batang values), sans Basic Latin (U+0020-007E, U+00A0) →
measured Malgun Gothic advances (space 0.352em, digits 0.551em; Noto's 0.224em
space alone drifted Korean sans line breaks ~3%/line —
`tools/normalize-kr-sans-hmtx.py`, asserted by `tests/kr-font-metrics.test.ts`).
The printable Latin outlines are also horizontally transformed to the measured
ink widths and side bearings of Batang/Malgun
(`tools/normalize-kr-latin-metrics.py`,
`tools/scale-kr-sans-latin-ink.py`).

`ChatOfficeCheLatinKR.woff2` is an ASCII-only derivative of ChatOffice Sans KR.
`tools/build-kr-che-latin-font.py` gives its Noto-derived outlines fixed 0.5em
advances and transforms them to measured DotumChe ink boxes. Microsoft Office
fonts are build-time measurement references only; no Microsoft outlines are
included. All three derivatives are renamed because the upstream OFL notices
reserve the name "Source"; "Noto" is the distribution family name, not the
Reserved Font Name. Conjoining jamo keep native advances (shaping). Word
counterpart line factors live in `lineHeightFactor()` of `line-metrics.ts`.

### ChatOffice Gothic KR

| Font                               | Role                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ChatOffice Gothic KR (subset woff2) | real-metric face for NanumGothic-declaring docs |

Source: NanumGothic Regular from [google/fonts](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/nanumgothic)
(SIL OFL 1.1). Word for Mac renders NanumGothic documents with the OS
_downloadable_ Nanum asset (FontServices subset Chromium cannot see): hangul
0.94em, space 0.28em, digits 0.606em (M3 probe 2026-08-14), while the
Batang-normalized subset above ships 1.0/0.333/0.596 — +6.4% per hangul line.
Subset to the same ranges as the KR fallbacks (KS X 1001 syllables + jamo +
Basic Latin/punctuation/fullwidth forms), advances **unmodified**
(`tools/build-gothic-kr-font.py`) and checked in as
`ChatOfficeGothicKR-Regular-subset.woff2`. Renamed per OFL (the upstream
Reserved Font Names include "Nanum" and "NanumGothic"; subsetting is a
modification). The exact NHN copyright/Reserved Font Name notice and the full
OFL 1.1 text are in `LICENSE-OFL.txt`.

### ChatOffice UI Kana JP

| Font                                      | Role                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ChatOffice UI Kana JP (Regular/Bold woff2) | Meiryo UI-advance kana/JP punctuation for the alias |

Source: Noto Sans JP variable font from [notofonts/noto-cjk](https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk)
(SIL OFL 1.1), instanced at wght 400/700. Word for Mac renders Meiryo UI with
its private copy whose kana are proportional (Word probe 2026-09-03: あ
0.816em, う 0.639em, ア 0.754em, ideographic space and 、。 0.664em, corner
brackets and ・ 0.5em) at full glyph height; the Hiragino fallback keeps them
at 1em, and a size-adjust alias shrinks height along with width. Subset to
U+3000-30FF code points whose Meiryo UI advance differs from 1em, each glyph
given that exact advance (`tools/meiryo-ui-kana-advances.json`) with the
outline condensed horizontally to fit; vertical metrics set to the Hiragino
class (0.88/-0.12) the glyphs sit next to (`tools/build-meiryo-ui-kana-font.py`).
Renamed per OFL ("Source" is a Reserved Font Name of the upstream and the
outlines are modified).

## Poppins (M365 cloud font)

| Font                             | Role                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ChatOffice Poppins (subset woff2) | real face for Poppins-declaring docs |

Source: Poppins Regular/Bold from [google/fonts](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/poppins)
(SIL OFL 1.1). Poppins is an M365 cloud font: Word downloads the real face and
lays out with its metrics (line box hhea = typo = 1.500em; Word probe
2026-09-01 measured factor exactly 1.500 at 10/12/16/28pt, regular and bold,
with the PDF embedding Poppins-Regular/Bold), while the Helvetica-class
fallback runs ~12.6% narrower per line and 1.172-spaced — a 13-page document
paginated as 11. Subset to Latin + Latin Extended + punctuation/currency,
advances and vertical metrics **unmodified** (`tools/build-poppins-font.py`),
checked in as `ChatOfficePoppins-{Regular,Bold}-subset.woff2`. Renamed (no
Reserved Font Name upstream) so a locally installed Poppins wins by chain
order. Italic synthesizes oblique from these faces.

## Tamil fallback

| Font                    | Role                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ChatOffice Tamil (woff2) | Latha-metric stand-in for Tamil families |

Source: Noto Sans Tamil Regular from [notofonts](https://github.com/notofonts/notofonts.github.io)
(SIL OFL 1.1). Word substitutes missing Tamil families with Latha; Chromium's
macOS fallback (Tamil Sangam MN) shapes ~27% narrower (M3 probe: sentence R
0.728, space 0.39×), far past what size-adjust can fix without inflating glyph
ink (137%). Advances are rewritten to Latha's: the 109 cmap-shared codepoints
exactly, remaining glyphs (GSUB conjunct/matra outputs) by the median
Tamil-letter ratio (`tools/build-tamil-font.py`; shaped sentence R vs Latha
0.994, every probe sentence within ±2.3%). The face ships no Latin letters
(upstream Noto Sans Tamil has none); Latin falls through the chain. Renamed
per OFL ("Noto" is a Reserved Font Name; advances are modified).

## Arabic fallback

| Font                             | Role                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Noto Naskh Arabic (subset woff2) | fallback for naskh/serif-class Arabic families (default) |
| Noto Sans Arabic (subset woff2)  | fallback for kufi/sans-class Arabic families             |

Source: Noto Naskh/Sans Arabic Regular from [notofonts/arabic](https://github.com/notofonts/arabic)
(SIL OFL 1.1), subset with fonttools to the Arabic blocks + presentation forms +
digits/punctuation, keeping all shaping features
(`pyftsubset --unicodes="U+0020-024F,U+0600-06FF,U+0750-077F,U+08A0-08FF,U+FB50-FDFF,U+FE70-FEFF,U+2000-206F" --layout-features='*' --flavor=woff2`).
Names are kept ("Noto ..."): glyphs and advances are unmodified, so the OFL
Reserved Font Name clause does not apply. The upstream fonts carry no Latin
letters (only digits/punctuation); Latin text in a cs-font run falls through to
the rest of the chain. Word substitutes a missing Arabic font with a naskh-style
serif, so unknown Arabic families default to the Naskh chain.

## PUA blanker

| Font                              | Role                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ChatOffice PUA Blank (woff2, 312B) | blank 1em glyph for all of U+E000-F8FF (BMP PUA) |

Generated from scratch by `tools/build-pua-blank-font.py` (no upstream font;
two glyphs, both empty). Chromium never system-falls-back for Private Use
codepoints: an unmapped PUA character renders the chain's primary font's
`.notdef`. Chains headed by a real face (Calibri, Carlito GO) therefore draw
tofu boxes for AI-residue PUA tokens, while Word — and chains headed by the
bundled CJK subsets, whose subsetted `.notdef` is blank — show nothing. This
face sits in the Aptos chain and behind the range-limited `Noto Sans/Serif
CJK GO` aliases so PUA stays invisible there too.
