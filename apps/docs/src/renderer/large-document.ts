 * Opening tiers by document weight = blocks + characters / CHARS_PER_BLOCK.

 * Measured 2026-09 (Apple silicon, renderer working set after pagination):
 * short synthetic paragraphs 30k blocks / 3 M chars → 1.26 GB, 1945 pages,
 * 17 s; long synthetic paragraphs 10k blocks / 7 M chars → 1.5 GB, 2038
 * pages, 11 s; 20k blocks / 14 M chars → 2.8 GB, 4080 pages, 32 s. That fits
 * about 300 MB + 17 KB per block + 150 B per character, so a block counts as
 * much as ~110 characters and the thresholds are expressed in that unit:
 * 60k short blocks (the earlier read-only line, ~1.1 GB) weigh ~115k.
 * The read-only tier keeps Read Mode's lighter path (the user can leave it);
 * past the refuse line the renderer would go down with the window instead.
