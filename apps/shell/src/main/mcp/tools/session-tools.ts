 * through their own bridge, but the *lifecycle* is identical: open a blank tab,
 * edit it, save it to a path, end the session. Registering one pair of
 * create_session / save_session tools instead of six near-identical ones keeps
 * the tool list the agent sees small, while each family module keeps owning its
 * own tab + editor protocol behind a FamilyDriver.
 *
 * Family ids, labels and the saveable extensions all come from the format
 * registry (./formats) so this surface tracks the editor instead of drifting
 * from it. One session is active at a time: creating a new session replaces the
 * previous one, so the content tools always address an unambiguous target.

 * redirects the edit from the session's own blank tab to one the user has open —
 * the bridges are addressed by webContents id, so no session is involved.
 *
 * With `focus`, the tab is also brought into view (activated, and the window
 * revealed) so the user watches the change land instead of it happening behind
 * a tab they cannot see. Mutating tools ask for it; reads do not, because an
 * agent sweeping several tabs for context should not make the UI jump along.
