/**
 * Read back the values of formulas a batch just wrote.
 *
 * A formula's *text* lands synchronously, but the engine computes its result
 * asynchronously. An external caller that reads immediately therefore sees
 * `value: null` for a formula it just wrote correctly, and `apply_sheet_ops`
 * returning "ok" while `read_sheet` shows nothing is indistinguishable from a
 * silent failure — an agent can conclude the edit did not take.
 *
 * In-app callers never meet this: the user watches the cell fill in. So the
 * MCP path closes the gap here, polling the addressed cells until the engine has
 * written their values and reporting them alongside the apply result. Polling
 * (rather than waiting on the engine's calculationEnd event) keeps it precise:
 * a batch of plain values triggers no recalculation at all, and must not hold
 * the response for a timeout that will never be met.
