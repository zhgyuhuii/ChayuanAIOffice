/**
 * Univer's TriggerCalculationController turns every set-range-values mutation
 * into a formula calculation cycle after a 100 ms debounce, and a cycle that
 * is still running when the next one arrives is stopped and restarted. Each
 * cycle rebuilds the dependency tree of every formula in the workbook (the
 * AST cache holds 5,000 entries), so a streamed load or a scroll through an
 * unloaded area of a workbook with thousands of formulas spends seconds per
 * chunk in the engine and never finishes a cycle (conditional formats that
 * depend on it stay unpainted). File data carries its cached values and needs
 * no recalculation per chunk: hold the engine's kick-off while chunks are
 * landing and release the accumulated dirty ranges as one cycle afterwards.
