# Deck spec for `chatoffice create --type pptx --spec`

The designed-deck path (`chatoffice guide slides design`) keeps one page per file:

```
deck/pages/01.json   { "title": "The 40% squeeze", "type": "cover", "layout": "cover_typography_hero", "background": "#0E1A2B", "elements": [ ... ] }
deck/pages/02.json   { "title": "Where the margin went", "type": "content", "layout": "three_column_cards", "background": "#FFFFFF", "elements": [ ... ] }
```

`title`, `type` and `layout` echo the page's outline entry; the builder ignores them, the checks compare them. `chatoffice slides check deck/pages/01.json` builds and audits one file, then checks it against `outline.json` and `style.md` (looked up beside the file and one folder up, or `--outline <file>`): file `NN.json` is outline entry `pages[N-1]`; an echoed field that disagrees or placeholder copy exits 1, a missing title or a planned photo without an image is a warning, and colors the style sheet does not name are listed in `detail.style.offPalette`. `chatoffice create --type pptx --spec deck/pages [--outline deck/outline.json] --out deck.pptx` takes every `*.json` in the folder in name order (`01`, `02`, … `10`), one slide each, runs the same checks on every file and refuses to build when the page count differs from the outline or a page disagrees with its entry. `chatoffice slides replace deck.pptx --slide n --spec deck/pages/NN.json` rebuilds slide n from its file after checking it against entry n.

`--spec` also accepts one file holding the whole deck, `{ "pages": [ {...}, {...} ] }`, a bare array of pages, or a single page object. Up to 60 pages. Every page becomes one 16:9 slide; the canvas is **1280 × 720 px**, origin top-left, all `x` `y` `w` `h` integers in px. Elements paint in array order (first = bottom). Colors are `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA` (`AA` alpha, `00` transparent).

## Outline

`deck/outline.json` is the plan the pages are written from; `chatoffice slides check` validates it:

```json
{
  "topic": "Regional logistics review 2024",
  "core_hook": "Margins fell 40% while volume grew",
  "pages": [
    {
      "title": "The 40% squeeze",
      "type": "cover",
      "layout": "cover_typography_hero",
      "brief": "Main title, subtitle with the period, presenter line; dark background from the style sheet.",
      "image_queries": []
    },
    {
      "title": "Where the margin went",
      "type": "content",
      "layout": "three_column_cards",
      "brief": "Three cards: fuel +31%, wages +18%, spot rates -22% (2024 vs 2022), one source line each.",
      "image_queries": ["container port cranes at dawn"]
    }
  ]
}
```

`type` is `cover`, `content`, `data` or `closing`; `layout` is one of that type's variants from the design guide's layout library. `image_queries` holds an English scene query per photo slot or a ready `http(s)` URL; `[]` for a page without photos. Errors from the check: unknown type or layout, missing title, brief, core hook or image_queries entries, placeholder copy (`XX%`, `lorem`, `TBD`), a content or data layout repeated on consecutive pages. Warnings: a thin brief, a non-English query, fewer than three layout variants across the body pages, a first page that is not a cover, a last page that is not a closing page.

## Element types

**Shape**

```json
{
  "type": "shape",
  "shape": "roundRect",
  "x": 80,
  "y": 120,
  "w": 360,
  "h": 200,
  "fill": "#1F3A5F",
  "stroke": { "color": "#FFFFFF", "widthPt": 1 },
  "valign": "middle",
  "paragraphs": [
    { "align": "center", "runs": [{ "text": "Label", "sizePt": 14, "color": "#FFFFFF" }] }
  ]
}
```

`shape` is one of `rect`, `roundRect`, `ellipse`, `triangle`, `rightArrow`, `leftArrow`, `upArrow`, `downArrow`, `chevron`, `diamond`, `parallelogram`, `trapezoid`, `hexagon`, `pentagon`, `pie`, `donut`, `star5`, `heart`, `cloud`, `line`, `lineArrow`. `line` and `lineArrow` draw the diagonal of their box from top-left to bottom-right and need a `stroke`; a horizontal rule is a box with `h: 1`. A shape needs a `fill` or a `stroke` (or both). `paragraphs` is optional label text, vertically centered unless `valign` says otherwise.

**Text**

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "x": 80,
  "y": 60,
  "w": 800,
  "h": 90,
  "valign": "top",
  "paragraphs": [
    {
      "align": "left",
      "lineSpacingPct": 110,
      "spaceAfterPt": 6,
      "bullet": false,
      "runs": [
        {
          "text": "Headline",
          "sizePt": 36,
          "bold": true,
          "color": "#0E1A2B",
          "font": "Helvetica Neue"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Run fields: `text` (required), `sizePt` (6 to 160), `bold`, `italic`, `color`, `font`. Paragraph fields: `runs` (required), `align` (`left` `center` `right` `justify`), `lineSpacingPct` (60 to 300), `spaceBeforePt` and `spaceAfterPt` (0 to 96), `bullet` (true = a • bullet with a hanging indent). A paragraph may mix runs of different size, weight and color (a big number run beside a small unit run). Text boxes have zero inner padding and wrap at their width; the builder measures every plain text box and grows it downwards when the content is taller (it never shrinks a box).

**Image**

```json
{ "type": "image", "url": "./assets/hero.jpg", "x": 660, "y": 80, "w": 540, "h": 560 }
```

`url` is a local file path (absolute, or relative to the current directory and then to the spec file's folder), a `data:` URL, or an `http(s)` URL that chatoffice downloads. The image is center-cropped to fill its box (object-fit: cover), so give the box roughly the picture's aspect ratio: a box that keeps less than half of the picture (a portrait product shot in a flat strip) lands but is reported as a warning. Up to 8 images per page. An image that cannot be read is dropped and listed in `detail.imageFailures`.

## Validation

Elements missing numeric geometry, lying fully outside the canvas, or of an unknown type are dropped with a warning; boxes that stick out are clamped to the canvas. Text elements without any text and shapes without fill or stroke are dropped. Two text boxes on one page with identical or near-identical text (a subtitle restating the chart caption) are kept but warned about, as is an image box that crops away more than half of its picture. A page with no surviving element fails; the deck fails only when no page survives. Everything dropped or warned about is reported in `detail.issues` per page. Up to 48 elements per page.

## After building

Elements get durable ids (`e_*`) and slides `s_<n>`; `chatoffice slides read deck.pptx --json` lists them for follow-up `chatoffice slides apply` ops. `chatoffice slides audit` reports out-of-bounds, text overflow and overlap per slide with the same ids; `chatoffice slides render` writes one PNG per slide for visual review; `chatoffice slides replace --slide n --spec <page.json>` swaps one slide for a rebuilt page (its element ids are new).
