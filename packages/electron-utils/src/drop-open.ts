/// channel; the shell routes each path through its normal open pipeline. The
/// installer runs inside preloads, where `webUtils.getPathForFile` is callable
/// and DOM listeners see real OS drops — paths never cross contextBridge.
///
/// Ownership contract with page-level drop zones: a zone that handles its own
/// file drops (AI attachment panels, slides image insert) cancels the event
/// before it bubbles here (`defaultPrevented`), and this bridge stays out of
/// the way. Text/media drags without OS files are untouched.
// The electron binding is required lazily (see electron-binding.ts): node-only
// hosts (the BFF server and the dsh sidecar) reach this module through
// package-root re-exports, where a top-level `import 'electron'` crashes plain
// Node. Only installDropOpenBridge, a preload-world call, touches the binding.
