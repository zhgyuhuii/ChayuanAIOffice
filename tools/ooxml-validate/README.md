# ooxml-validate

Schema gate for `.pptx` output. `validate-pptx.mjs` runs every
PresentationML / DrawingML part through Markup Compatibility preprocessing
and validates it with `xmllint` against the ISO/IEC 29500-4 (Transitional)
XML schemas in `schemas/`.

Well-formedness checks and python-pptx cannot see a second fill child in an
`a:rPr`, an `a:ln` after `a:effectLst`, or `sz="50"`; PowerPoint can, and
answers with a repair prompt that drops shapes. This tool sees them too.

```bash
node tools/ooxml-validate/validate-pptx.mjs deck.pptx                 # absolute
node tools/ooxml-validate/validate-pptx.mjs --base original.pptx edited.pptx   # only what the edit introduced
node tools/ooxml-validate/validate-pptx.mjs --json ...                # machine-readable
```

Requires `xmllint` (macOS ships it; Debian/Ubuntu: `libxml2-utils`).

Consumers: `packages/pptx-engine/tests/ooxml-schema.test.ts` (engine output
must validate; fixture edits must add no violation) and
`packages/pptx-engine/tests/corpus-edit-fuzz.test.ts`, which runs with `--base`
so a foreign deck's pre-existing quirks are not charged to the edit.

## Schemas

`schemas/*.xsd` are the ISO/IEC 29500-4:2016 Transitional schemas (identical
to ECMA-376 Part 4), taken from the `ref/xsd` directory of python-docx. Only
the PresentationML closure is kept: `pml`, `dml-main`, `dml-chart`,
`dml-chartDrawing`, `dml-diagram`, `dml-lockedCanvas`, `dml-picture`,
`shared-commonSimpleTypes`, `shared-relationshipReference`.

Local amendment (marked `ChatOffice amendment` in the file):

- `dml-main.xsd` `CT_TextBulletSizePercent/@val` is bound to `ST_TextBulletSize`
  (the union that includes the 25000..400000 decimal form). The published
  schema binds it to the percent-string form only, which rejects every
  `a:buSzPct` PowerPoint writes.

Calibration: 41 PowerPoint-authored decks (built-in themes and layouts)
validate clean; edited copies of them add no violation over their originals.

## MCE preprocessing

No extension namespace is treated as understood: attributes and elements in
`mc:Ignorable` namespaces are dropped, every `mc:AlternateContent` collapses
to its `mc:Fallback`, `mc:*` attributes are removed. Extension payloads in
`a:ext` / `p:ext` are `lax` in the schema and pass untouched.
